# Contact Form Component

A responsive, modern contact form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to be easily reused in any project. The form includes input validation, custom radio buttons, a checkbox, and a success message animation.

## Features

- Fully responsive for desktop and mobile

- Custom radio buttons and checkbox styling

- Smooth hover and focus states

- Validation for required fields and email format

- Animated success message

- Easy to integrate into any project

## Demo

You can open the HTML file in your browser to see the form in action.

## Files

The component consists of three main files:

- index.html – HTML structure of the form

- style.css – Styling for the form and success message

- script.js – Form validation and success message logic

## Installation

- Copy the three files into your project folder.

- Make sure the CSS and JavaScript files are correctly linked in your HTML.

- Open the HTML file in your browser to check layout and functionality.

## Usage

- Insert the HTML form into your page.

- Keep class names and IDs the same to ensure styling and functionality work correctly.

- You can change the heading, text, or labels, but keep IDs used in JavaScript for validation.

## Customization

- Colors and Fonts: The form uses a primary green, light green background, medium and dark grey, and the Karla font. You can update these to match your branding.

- Form Fields: You can add, remove, or rename fields, but make sure IDs match JavaScript validation.

- Success Message: You can change the text or style of the success message container.

## Form Submission

The form does not send data to a server by default. You have two options:

### Simulation: The form shows a success message when all fields pass validation.

### Real submission: Connect the form to a backend or a service like Formspree. Validation and success message will still work.

## Notes

- The form is mobile-first and works on screens from 375px to 1440px.

- Compatible with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

- Accessible: labels are linked to inputs, focus states are visible.

- Reusable: you can copy the container and form structure into other pages or projects.
